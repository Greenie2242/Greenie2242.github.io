What can humans do to help guide these polar bears into a satisfying life style. 
One where ice is so vast, that all they see is white? Well for starters the carbon dioxide thats released is because of us burning coal and other fossil fuels.
Once the burning of these gases are complete a chemical such as carbon dioxide is released into the atmosphere warming its temperature. 
There are many steps that our world can take to reduce the effects of global warming. Such as driving smarter cars, meaning driving hybrids or smart cars. 
There are newer cars that even run off electricity which help the environment. 
These cars also provide benefits such as better gas milage, occasionally more room, and can save you up to three thousand dollars in gas expenditures over the duration of its life. 
Compared to a car or truck that retains around twenty or less miles per gallon. Another problem with people is that in the city some choose to drive rather than walk, bike, or take the train. 
Driving less in the city will prevent pollution from cars, and improve the atmosphere we live in. It is almost impossible to say that everyone in the world can or could abide by these simple rules because quite frankly a good percentage of the population could care less. 
People should not worry about the costs, because not everyone is going to buy a new car or walk in the city. There are easy little ideas that help too. This could be changing your light bulbs to fluorescent bulbs, which saves about three hundred pounds of carbon dioxide per year, for just a bulb change.
Other things like wrapping your water heater in an insulation blanket could save up to one thousand pounds of carbon dioxide. If you have the time and money you could insulate and weatherize your home which in return lessens the amount of carbon dioxide by two thousand pounds per year. 
An easy thing such as recycling can save two thousand four hundred pounds of carbon dioxide per year. Take a pledge to any website that says reduce the effects of global warming. 
Speak out to your community, because I feel if this issue was handed out to each and every state governor, or leaders around the world, we could change the earth's temperature. 
It is very important because without uniting as a country the lives of these polar bears could dwindle out. If we as a society can provoke awareness to this situation than we can slowly nip away at the Arctic climate, cooling it down.

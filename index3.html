<h1> Traveling Conditions </h1>
<p style="background: yellow; color: black; font-family: Arial;">
Polar bears need to travel in order to survive. If their traveling is cut short due to ice gaps in the arctic ocean there's a major problem. 
This problem has been going on for years. In the past decade, 2012 was the ninth warmest year since 1880. 
32 years of increasing temperature should make us worry. As the heat continuously rises, not only are the polar bears being affected but we eventually could be affected. 
By affecting us there would be more civil conflict, the food supply could eventually dwindle, heat could rise and there would be more storms and flooding. 
This should peak interest in the world. Maybe humans are making it harder for these polar bears to travel properly. 
Exploiting unreasonable amounts of gas into the atmosphere helps nothing. The world although cannot just change from the snap of a finger.
It takes lots of time for the atmosphere to cool down.From 1895 to 1915 was recorded the most severe drop in temperature over a short time.
The recorded drop was about 0.2 degrees celsius. This is important to note because the temperature drop is a positive thing for polar bears, because it helps out their cold environment. 
Traveling can be a very difficult thing for most bears. Swimming hundreds of miles is just a warmup for these bears due to the insane amount of miles they swim per day.

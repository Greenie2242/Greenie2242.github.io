<h1> Cannibalism </h1>
<p style="background: green; color: black; font-family: Arial;">
Bears aren’t just carnivores, they can be cannibalistic too. 
Species such as cats, fish, octopuses, king cobras, orangutans, sand tiger sharks, bullfrogs, lobsters, and trust me the list could go on, plus all these species fall under the category of cannibals. 
The sad thing is these bears are ranked fifth among the most cannibalistic species on earth. It doesn’t help that the environment they live in provides mostly water, dry land and little amounts of ice. 
It can get quite hard to venture off during the day and find food. Bears sometimes hunt in packs but usually hunt alone. Seals are these bears main priority day in and day out. 
Finding a seal cub size or larger can last for days depending on the hunger of the polar bear. Usually in polar bear cases they tend to devour their meal in one sitting. 
The polar bear’s favorite snack are ringed seals. The bears actually wait for these seals to pop up near breathing holes in the ice. Bears are very smart, and patient, and can wait up to days next to a breathing hole for a seal to pop up. 
The funny thing is the polar bears may fall asleep at the most important moments.
